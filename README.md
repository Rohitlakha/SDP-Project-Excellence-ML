## About

This repository contains materials, notebooks and exercises for the *Project Excellence ‚Äì ML* component of the SDP. It is organized day-wise covering topics from data processing, feature engineering, supervised & unsupervised learning, validation, tuning, to deployment.

---

## How to Use This Repo

1. Go through the notebooks in order of days so that concepts build progressively.  
2. Run the notebooks locally (or on a cloud / notebook environment) to follow along with code + explanations.  
3. Try modifying or extending the examples (use different datasets, tune hyperparameters etc.) to deepen your learning.  
4. Use ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù / ‚ÄúPull Requests‚Äù if you want to add new content or correct something.
